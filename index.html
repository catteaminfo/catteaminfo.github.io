            <h3 class="banner">The CAT TEAM alarm is a catalytic converter alarm system that helps deter and prevent catalytic converter theft. 
                The alarm is triggered by the vibration caused by cutting implements, and emits a piercing audible alarm. 
                The alarm system is also capable of real time user notifications. Upon detection of an attempted theft, the
                user can be notified by SMS text messages.
                The device will also perform video image capture of the theft.

            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p  class="two-p">We are a group of students from Arizona State University who've decided to do something about catalytic converter thefts. In the fall of 2021, our of our
                team members, Sam Kacprowicz, was returning to his car at an ASU garage, after a long day writing code on campus. He attempted to start his car, only to find out that his catalytic converter
                had been stolen.
            </p>

        <p class="two-p">
            Eventually we needed to complete a capstone project for our last year at ASU. The idea of a catalytic converter alarm
            had been ruminating in our heads since the theft happened, and we decided to give it a go and see what we could come up with.
